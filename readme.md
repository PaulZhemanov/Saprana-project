# Introduction

A platform that allows you to raise funds to organize concerts, promotions and other events through NFT.

## Decentralized Ticket Marketplace with Ongoing NFT Benefits: A Collaborative Vision with Saprana Project

* There should be a marketplace where people can buy tickets. 
* Users need to be able to browse tickets in their wallets
* NFT Hodlers get access to all goodies on site
* These NFT tickets are not a one-off purchase. the story continues after the event is over. Some digital content should be there, access to a gated community, it can be traded even after it’s over. So all that should be designed in collab with Saprana project.
