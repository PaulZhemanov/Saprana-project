# Introduction

A platform that allows you to raise funds to organize concerts, promotions and other events through NFT.

## Decentralized Ticket Marketplace with Ongoing NFT Benefits: A Collaborative Vision with Saprana Project

*There should be a marketplace where people can buy tickets. 
*Users need to be able to browse tickets in their wallets
*NFT Hodlers get access to all goodies on site
*These NFT tickets are not a one-off purchase. the story continues after the event is over. Some digital content should be there, access to a gated community, it can be traded even after it’s over. So all that should be designed in collab with Saprana project.
